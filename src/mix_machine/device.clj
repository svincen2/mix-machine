;; TODO
;; ready? isn't used at all
;; Some of the devices probably don't work the way they should.
;;   Line printer, for example, has an IOC operation that skips it forward
;;   to the top of the next page.  I'm not sure what to do there.
;;   Also, Paper Tape has an IOC to rewind, but not to seek the same way a Tape does.
;;   For now, Paper Tape is a SeekableDevice, but only rewinds are allowed.
